# ezy-install

**ezy-install** is a lightweight command-line launcher that fetches and runs installation scripts directly from this repository. It simplifies the setup of common solutions with one command.

- Extensible: add your own `.sh` scripts to the repo  
- Supported Systems: [Rocky Linux 10](https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/10/isos/x86_64/Rocky-10.0-x86_64-minimal.iso) (or compatible RHEL-based systems)
